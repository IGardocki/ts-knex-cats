# ts-knex-cats
This is a simple recreation of knex cats, but in TS. My goals were to learn TS and get more comfortable with TDD.

## Things I learned:
To set up a TS react app, use the cmd:

npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
(https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
<<<<<<< HEAD

This was helpful for setting context in react:
